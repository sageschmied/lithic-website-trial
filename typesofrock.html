                    <h2>Stone tools can be made out of many different types of rock, learn about the most common types here!</h2>
                    <p class="lead">
                      <ol>
<li> Chert- Chert is a sedimentary rock type that comes in various colors. It is extremely fine grained and looks sort of like a milky glass (not as glassy as obsidian though). It is often spotted in assemblages because of the shininess of the rock and its smooth surface. It is fairly hard but flakes well making it a good rock type for tool making.</li>
<li>Obsidian- The glassiest rock of all, obsidian is a volcanic rock type that is literally created after lava cools. It is extremely strong and beautiful and easily the most sought after material for tool making. There is evidence of extensive trade of the material and it has been known to create some of the most magnificent tools.</li>
<li>Basalt- Another volcanic rock, Basalt is characterized by being a fine grained black rock. It is very common to find and often used because of this fact. </li>
<li>Granite-  A volcanic rock with a course texture. It is easy to see the various elements of granite because of the coarseness of the grains. It is not the best material for flaking however it is hard and can be good for hammerstones or grinders.</li>
<li>Quartzite- A metamorphic rock dominated by the quartz mineral, it is hard and can fracture more consistently than granite because the grains are more medium than coarse. However, its fractures are usually wavier. It comes in various colors and has the crystalline look of quartz.</li>
<li>Schist- Schist is a metamorphic rock that is medium to coarse grained. It fractures in sheets and usually has a shine/ shimmer to its grey blue color. It fractures easily, however it can be rather soft making for tools that do not have much use time. </li>
