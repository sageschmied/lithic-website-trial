                    <p class="lead"> <ol>

                       <li> Hammer and anvil- This sort of production is probably the least finessed of the stone tool productions. Tools are made by hitting the core of stone (the rock in which the tool will be made from) on to a larger stationary rock. This sort of production will cause large flaking (pieces of the rock to flake off) where the core was hit against the stationary stone. This sort of production is the hardest to control as there is no real precision in hitting the smaller stone against the larger rock.</li> 

                       <li> Bipolar- This production type is a little more finessed than the hammer and anvil, however it is still not the best. In this case the core is placed again on the larger rock, however another rock if used to hit the core against the stationary one. This produces many pieces (or flake) some of which may be useable as stone tools. </li>

                       <li> Hammer Percussion (soft and hard)- Soft and Hard hammer percussion refers to the type of hammerstone (rock used to hit the core against the stationary rock. In hard hammer percussion, the hammer used is generally made of a harder material than the core and the core is held in the hand on the stationary rock rather than just being smashed by the hammer like in bipolar production. Soft hammer is similar in that it is the same technique but it usually uses a softer material hammer than the core being hit. Typically, in soft hammer production the pieces of rock that come off (flakes) are more so peeled than anything else and this allows the person creating it a lot of finesse. These techniques both offer a lot of control to the person creating the tool and allow for precision and accuracy.</li> 

                      <li>  Pressure Flaking- This production is generally used to sharpen and create the tool into its finished state. Mostly used for the edges, pressure flaking will be used for the duration of the tools life to sharpen it. A smaller, more flexible, durable tool is used to remove these small flakes (such as antler) and generally this technique also peels the flakes away. </li>
