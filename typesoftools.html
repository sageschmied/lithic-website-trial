                    <h2>Learn about different types of tools, how they are classified and what they look like!</h2>
                    <p class="lead"> <ul>
                    <li>Core- A core is a stone tool that shows evidence of flake scars (pits from where pieces of rock have been taken off (flakes)). These flakes are generally then used to make other tools. Cores may or may not be utilized after this point by pressure flaking on the edges to create a tool with more uses.</li>
<li>Scraper- A scrapper is tool that generally has one or both edges flaked and an unflaked end for holding in the hand. This flaked edge is then used to scrape things such as hide from animal flesh. Scrapers have that characteristic serrated edge for this purpose and usually are fairly flat tools.</li>
<li>Flakes-Flakes can have many uses and may or may not be utilized (re-flaked by pressure flaking). Flakes generally are just the pieces that come off the core in order for the tool to be created. However, if these flakes are not made into tools themselves, they may just undergo some pressure flaking to create an edge that can be utilized for various purposes. </li>
<li>Knives-Knives are usually longer tools with one or two edges being sharpen for use. They usually fit into the hand and are not as serrated as scrapers are (they are also usually not as flat). They can generally be used for any sort of cutting job.</li>
<li>Points- Points are generally small, pointed, triangular shaped, tools (more commonly known as arrowheads), that may have a variety of uses. Although they could be used for arrowheads, they also can be used for spears for example, and this does not have to be restricted to land either, points can be used in fishing scenarios as well.</li>
<li>Bifaces- Similar to points, they are usually larger and are guaranteed to have both sides undergo flaking. They may have serrated edges and are often flat with more rounded edges than the triangular points.</li>
<li>Choppers- Generally formed from hammer and anvil production, choppers have one irregular flaked edge while the opposite side is usually rounded and untouched. The tools are very rough and will vary in the number of flakes taken from the one side. As the name suggests they are used for chopping, hacking and cutting to name a few possible uses.</li>
<li>Grinders- Grinders are usually round stones that would be used in similarly to a mortar and pestle. They may be used to grind various things such as plants to make dye.   Grinders are usually identified from their round shape compared to other stone tools or rocks found, they may also have grinding marks (lines or striations) on the surface of the rock. Sometimes they may also have leftover plant materials or traces of whatever they were used for grinding.</li> 
<li>Hammerstones- As discussed hammerstones are generally used for the production of stone tools. They are usually large and round or oval in shape. They may also be for the hammering of other objects or for the cracking of bones, or other types of hard shelled food. They are usually identified by their largeness and their surface often has pitting (dents) from the hammering of objects.</li>
<li>Preforms- Preforms are the state of the lithic tool before it has been created into the type of tool it was meant to be. Generally, it has some sort of flaking, grinding, sawing or etching on it to show that first stage step of creation. They can be all shapes and sizes, depending on the final product it was meant to be.</li>
